# Cartpole_RL_Gym

This project is a tutorial which helps in introducing ourselves to the world of Reinforcement Learning.

This involves the usage of OpenAI Gym (now Gynasium) and a RL library called Stablebaselines3 which is based on PyTorch.

This environment corresponds to the version of the cart-pole problem described by Barto, Sutton, and Anderson in “Neuronlike Adaptive Elements That Can Solve Difficult Learning Control Problem”. A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction on the cart.
